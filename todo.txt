# To-do:
#  - Considerations:
    # - modelling the wing tips accurately and cleanly is important. Be careful with interpolation schemes, and 
    # how well the segment discretisation matches the intended geometry.
    # - at 5 and 10 kts, wake roll up seems to make negligible difference to overall loads
        # - Uncertain whether roll up would affect stability
    # - wake reflection doesn't seem to make too much difference either

# - Tests:
    # - write test to check jax auto diff of residual is working
    # - write test of root finding algorithm wth analytical function?
    # - finish elliptical wing test, are there any other things I can test from that?
        # - Get auto test in github?

# - Coding:
    # - implement different method for inputting wing geometry
        # - try and mimic some of the AXIS foils
        # - do some investigations around aerofoil profiles and typical afoil thicknesses. How much effect on loads do these have for the AXIS profiles?
        # - Given an AXIS-recommended setup - do the loads look sensible?
    # - need to work out a reasonable design Lift force for kiting, then can see what angles would be required to achieve this over a range of speeds
    # - check out ncrit for hydrofoils and how to change this in aeropy
    # - add option for variable relative thickness from root to tip (10 -> 8%?)
    # - look into pitch, roll, yaw stability
    # - try parallel for loop on loop through angles?


# - Unanswered questions:
    # - does large dt make for lower accuracy?
    # - should ommitting shed vortex elements result in same answer?
