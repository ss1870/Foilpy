To-do:
- Considerations:
    - modelling the wing tips accurately and cleanly is important. Be careful with interpolation schemes, and 
    how well the segment discretisation matches the intended geometry.
    - at 5 and 10 kts, wake roll up seems to make negligible difference to overall loads
        - Uncertain whether roll up would affect stability
    - wake reflection doesn't seem to make too much difference either

- Tests:
    - write test to check jax auto diff of residual is working
    - write test of root finding algorithm wth analytical function?
    - finish elliptical wing test, are there any other things I can test from that?
        - Get auto test in github?

- Coding:
    - Specify planform using spline for chord and some sweep kinda parameter i.e. mid chord, LE or TE.
	- Try optimise planform for constant lift at specified AoA/speed, and minimum drag?
    - look into pitch, roll, yaw stability
    - try parallel for loop on loop through angles?


- Unanswered questions:
    - does large dt make for lower accuracy?
    - should ommitting shed vortex elements result in same answer?
    - steady solve: can I just do a single solve for bound and infinitely long trailing vorticity?
